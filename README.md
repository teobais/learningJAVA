learningJAVA
============
Here is a small amount of code examples that I have been through when I first started learning JAVA; most of them, are from <a href="http://www.deitel.com/Books/Java/JavaHowtoProgram7e/tabid/1191/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Deitel's</a> book.

Hope you 'll make the best out of it, enjoy!
